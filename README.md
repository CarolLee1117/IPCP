# IoT Plant Caring Platform, IPCP

## Purpose of the System
The purpose of this system is to provide a simple yet user-friendly plant care solution for users who have limited time or lack experience in cultivating small plants, such as office workers, gardening beginners, and students. The system allows users to easily access real-time information about the condition of their plants, including environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and brightness. When any of these conditions fall short of the requirements for plant growth, the system will automatically perform actions such as watering or turning on a grow light. Additionally, users can remotely decide whether to water the plant or turn on the grow light based on the data provided. Ultimately, this system aims to reduce the difficulty of growing small plants and help ensure their healthy growth.


## System Scope
This system will cover hardware devices, software applications, as well as related user documentation and technical support.

### Purpose:
To provide a plant care system for small plants that collects status data such as temperature, humidity, and brightness. Based on this data, the system can automatically or manually (by the user) adjust humidity and brightness.

### Main Features:
- Humidity Monitoring:
  Allows the system and the user to observe the current soil humidity of the small plant.
- Temperature Monitoring:
  Allows the system and the user to observe the current ambient temperature around the plant.
- Brightness Monitoring:
  Allows the system and the user to observe the current ambient light level for the plant.
- Watering:
  Enables the system or the user to adjust humidity and temperature through an automated watering device.
- Plant Light Control:
  Enables the system or the user to adjust the brightness using a plant grow light.

### Users:
Any user who purchases this plant care system.

### Interface:
A web-based interface is provided for the primary user to operate the system.
